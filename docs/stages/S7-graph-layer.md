# S7: Graph layer (late)

Status: planned (deliberately late)
Depends on: S6 acceptance
ADRs: ADR-0013 (DP/Viterbi traversal), ADR-0014 (fretboard-aware model)

## Goal

Graph-driven recombination over phrases, motifs, and rhythm cells — only after
stable chunks and features exist. The hypergraph is the *map* (what is
connected / possible); DP/Viterbi is the *route* (which sequence is best).

## Inputs / Outputs

- In: corpus chunks + features (≥ ~100 phrases recommended before this pays
  off).
- Out: a (hyper)graph (nodes + edges) and a DP/Viterbi traversal producing the
  optimal candidate chain.

## Approach

- Node types: `Phrase`, `Motif`, `RhythmCell`, `ChordMovement`,
  `EnergyState`.
- Edges: similarity (cosine on feature vectors), transition probability
  (counted from corpus), tag co-occurrence. Complement relations (§9) are
  multi-feature **hyperedges**, not binary edges.
- Traversal: **DP/Viterbi** as the primary mechanism (ADR-0013) — deterministic
  by construction (SPEC §6), optimising the whole sequence rather than picking
  the locally-best candidate per bar. Beam search is kept only as an
  approximation for graphs too large for exact DP.
- DP state carries running context: current candidate, fretboard position
  (ADR-0014), last technique, `EnergyState`, rhythmic similarity to part A.
- Cost function (inspectable, the same weights S9 later tunes):
  `harmonic_fit + rhythm_complement + style_fit + playability + phrase_continuity
  − mud_penalty − repetition_penalty − fret_jump_penalty`.

## Acceptance criteria

- Recombined chains beat S6 single-strategy output on a defined quality score.
- Deterministic for a fixed cost function (Viterbi optimum is unique; ties break
  by a fixed documented rule).
- Multi-bar output shows a global arc (e.g. no 4 identical-technique bars in a
  row), not a chain of locally-best fragments.

## Open questions

- Minimum corpus size before the graph beats rule-based v0.
- Exact cost-term weights (calibrated on the corpus; later tuned by S9).
- State-size vs exactness trade-off before beam search is needed.
