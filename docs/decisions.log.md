- 2026-05-19 — In the context of bootstrapping the knowledge base, facing a
  Russian constitution but an English-only repo, we decided for a condensed
  English translation of the glossary (all terms preserved, prose tightened)
  and against a verbatim 1:1 translation or keeping Russian, to achieve a
  readable in-repo constitution, accepting that some authorial commentary is
  dropped.

- 2026-05-19 — In the context of mislabeled `feat(sN)` commits, facing a
  conflict with the canonical roadmap, we decided for keeping git history plus
  an audit doc and canonical numbering forward, and against rewriting history,
  to achieve honesty without destabilizing a published branch, accepting that
  old commit messages stay wrong (reconciled in `docs/audit/`).

- 2026-05-19 — In the context of the fuzzing-strategy planning branch, facing
  a freshly discovered `group_into_bars` hang/OOM (finding F-001), we decided
  for committing it unfixed as the first regression corpus seed plus an
  `#[ignore]`d root-cause repro test, and against fixing it on a planning
  branch, to achieve a permanent reproducer without an untested behavior
  change, accepting that the bug stays live until S0/S2 fix it behind a
  characterization test.
