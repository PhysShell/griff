- 2026-05-19 — In the context of bootstrapping the knowledge base, facing a
  Russian constitution but an English-only repo, we decided for a condensed
  English translation of the glossary (all terms preserved, prose tightened)
  and against a verbatim 1:1 translation or keeping Russian, to achieve a
  readable in-repo constitution, accepting that some authorial commentary is
  dropped.

- 2026-05-19 — In the context of mislabeled `feat(sN)` commits, facing a
  conflict with the canonical roadmap, we decided for keeping git history plus
  an audit doc and canonical numbering forward, and against rewriting history,
  to achieve honesty without destabilizing a published branch, accepting that
  old commit messages stay wrong (reconciled in `docs/audit/`).

- 2026-05-19 — In the context of S0 golden CLI tests, facing the `insta` vs
  hand-rolled snapshot-tooling open question, we decided for hand-rolled plain
  golden text files (compared in-process, re-blessed via `GRIFF_BLESS=1`) and
  against the `insta` crate, to keep the workspace dependency tree and the
  strict `cargo-deny`/clippy posture intact, accepting slightly less ergonomic
  snapshot review.

- 2026-05-19 — In the context of S0 `.mid` fixtures, facing the in-repo
  real-MIDI vs synthetic open question, we decided for fully synthetic minimal
  fixtures generated with `midly` (committed, byte-pinned by an in-sync guard
  test) and against any licensed real guitar MIDI, to avoid licensing concerns
  and keep the importer's golden inputs deterministic, accepting that the
  fixtures are not musically realistic.

- 2026-05-31 — In the context of adding ComplementArranger, facing where to slot
  it in the canonical roadmap, we decided for appending it as `S13` (next free
  number, `Depends on: S6`) and against renumbering `S7…S12`, to keep the
  project's append-only posture and avoid renaming six stage files, accepting
  that the integer no longer reflects logical position (captured by the
  dependency note and `docs/audit/2026-05-s13-complementary-arranger.md`).

- 2026-05-31 — In the context of the first ComplementArranger version, facing
  rule-derived vs corpus-mined complement relations, we decided for purely
  generative (derive part B from part A by rule) and against mining real
  two-guitar pairs now, to ship a deterministic baseline without a corpus-schema
  change, accepting that `ChunkMeta` carries no pair relations yet
  (`schema_version` stays 1) and that learning from real pairs is deferred to
  the graph layer.

- 2026-05-31 — In the context of the canon-lift needed for ComplementArranger,
  facing how much of the legacy linear model to retire now, we decided for
  porting only `feature` and `generate` to the canonical model and against a
  full legacy removal up front (ADR-0011), to unblock the new engine cheaply,
  accepting that `classify`/`slice`/the CLI import path stay on the legacy model
  until later characterization-gated ports.
